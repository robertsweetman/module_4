# Stakeholder Engegement & crafting a solution <!-- 500 words -->

## Key stakeholders and requirements
<!--
Identify key stakeholders, then gather and prioritise requirements
-->
Key stakeholders are the business leaders responsible for the sales effort in Ireland, the development team who build and deploy internal applications and the support team responsible for ongoing management of their applications.

Each of these groups have differing requirements, arguably split between business and technical considerations. It's clear that the Development and Support team's focus isn't the same since one is more concerned with building and deploying whereas the second team is more interested in running and maintainability.

- **Sales Team**: Focus on usability, visibility, and deadline management (core business needs)
- **Tech Team**: Emphasis on security, compliance, and authentication (protecting sensitive tender data)
- **Support Team**: Priority on maintainability, alarms, user management, and documentation (keeping the system running smoothly)
